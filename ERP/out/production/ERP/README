1) The Feedback class uses a generic type parameter (T), which means the data type for feedback attributes
    such as courseCode, rating, and comments can be defined when an object of the Feedback class is instantiated.
    This allows the class to handle multiple types of data while keeping the code reusable and type-safe.

2) TA class is inherited by student class. It has all the functions of a student and additional (assigning grade and viewing students).
    TA can only view/assign grades to the students enrolled in his assigned course (course of which that student is a TA)

3) Exception handling :

    1) Course drop deadline passed - I have used Java's local time library which would check student's dropping date
    with the deadline date which i have made fixed (hard coded- 25th Oct 2024)

    2) Invalid login- It passes an error if either the email or password credentials are wrong

    3) Invalid course registration- in my registration method, i first get the total enrollment limit. after registering the course,
     i subtract that limit number by 1 and set the new enrollment limit. When the limit becomes 0, it will throw an error of exceeding
     enrollment limit.

4) Functionalities:

    1) Feedback system- I have kept the feedback system anonymous. Students can fill the feedback by giving course code, rating and comments.
    Professor can view the feedback of the subject he is currently teaching and not all feedbacks.

    2)TA - i have not made another user portal for TA as TA is a student itself. when a student is logged in, he gets an option
    to log in as a TA further where the program checks the credentials and makes the functionalities of TA available.

    3)Functions of TA includes viewing and grading the students enrolled in his assigned course.
